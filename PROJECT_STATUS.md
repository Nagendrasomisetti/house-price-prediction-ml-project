### 4. **Add All Files (except venv and large data, if you want)**
You should add a `.gitignore` file to avoid uploading unnecessary files like your virtual environment and possibly large data files. Here’s a recommended `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
*.pkl
*.npy
*.csv
```
If you want to upload your data and model files, remove `*.pkl`, `*.npy`, and `*.csv` from the `.gitignore`.
